	<code>Sorry to hear, but your application to join project "{{me.project}}" was rejected. Don't feel bad -- it's probably not you. That spot likely was just filled before you asked. Or maybe the project's needs changed.

	Either way, donâ€™t worry! Head back to http://nicar.adamplayford.com; there are going to be many other projects to join.</code>
