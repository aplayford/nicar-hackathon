An automated note from nicar.adamplayford.com:

Sorry to hear, but your application to join project "{{project}}" was rejected. Don't feel bad -- it's probably not you. That spot likely just filled before you asked. Or maybe the project's needs changed.

Either way, donâ€™t worry! Head back to http://nicar.adamplayford.com; there are going to be many other projects to join.

Thanks,
