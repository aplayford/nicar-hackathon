Sorry to hear, but you were rejected from joining {{project}}. Don't feel bad. It's probably not you: That spot may have been filled before you asked, or the project's needs may have changed.

But donâ€™t worry! Head back to http://nicar.adamplayford.com; there are going to be many other projects to join.

Thanks,
